    <p>Satoshi Nakamoto is the name used by the unknown person or people who developed bitcoin, authored the bitcoin white paper, and created and deployed bitcoin's original reference implementation.[1] As part of the implementation, they also devised the first blockchain database.[2] In the process they were the first to solve the double-spending problem for digital currency using a peer-to-peer network. They were active in the development of bitcoin up until December 2010.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>On a P2P Foundation profile, Nakamoto claimed to be a man living in Japan, born on 5 April 1975.[3] Speculation about the true identity of Nakamoto has mostly focused on a number of cryptography and computer science experts of non-Japanese descent, living in the United States and various European countries.[4] Satoshi Nakamoto also created the bitcointalk forum, and posted the first message in 2009 under the pseudonym satoshi.[5]</p>

    <h3>Development of bitcoin</h3>
    <p>In October 2008, Nakamoto published a paper[6][7] on the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com[8] describing the bitcoin digital currency. It was titled "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System". In January 2009, Nakamoto released the first bitcoin software that launched the network and the first units of the bitcoin cryptocurrency, called bitcoins.[9][10] Satoshi Nakamoto released the Version 0.1 of bitcoin software on Sourceforge on 9 January 2009.

            Nakamoto claimed that work on the writing of the code began in 2007.[11] Nakamoto knew that due to its nature, the core design would have to be able to support a broad range of transaction types. The implemented solution enabled specialized codes and data fields from the start through the use of a predicative script.[12]
            
            Nakamoto created a website with the domain name bitcoin.org and continued to collaborate with other developers on the bitcoin software until mid-2010. Around this time, he handed over control of the source code repository and network alert key to Gavin Andresen,[13] transferred several related domains to various prominent members of the bitcoin community, and stopped his involvement in the project. Until shortly before his absence and handover, Nakamoto made all modifications to the source code himself.
            
            On 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network came into existence with Satoshi Nakamoto mining the genesis block of bitcoin (block number 0), which had a reward of 50 bitcoins.[14][15] Embedded in the coinbase transaction of this block was the text:</p>
